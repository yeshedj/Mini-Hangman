# Mini Hangman 

Hangman is a classic word game in which the user must guess the hidden word before they run out of attempts. 

_Mini Hangman_ is an adaption of the game and was implemented as a final project for our COMP 123: Core Concepts of Computer Science course. Our four-person team collaborated to create our first-ever CS game.

## Takeaways

As a team, we learned and familiarized ourselves with Tkinter. By using a GUI to display our Hangman Game, we were able to play around with positioning, buttons, and labels. 
When running into errors and debugging, we problem-solved and learned to identify issues in our code. This helped to hone our skills in troubleshooting and overcoming coding challenges. 
The overall concept of the game worked out the way we thought it would. The functionalities and ideas of the game werenâ€™t too complicated since we all had a good grasp of how the game works. 
It was surprising to see how we could enrich our GUI by incorporating different aspects and components. Initially, we had not expected such versatility but as we worked on it we found 
potential to include more and more creative elements; the images and hangman figure in particular. Additionally, it was interesting to observe how the placement of the image at different 
locations in the code would either make it work or fail. From this, we learned how important it is to understand the context and order of the code. 

For future extensions, we will probably do some things differently. 
For example, we will add music and offer the user a more personalized experience by providing them with the option to choose from multiple themed dictionaries. Once they pick a theme, the user can guess words associated 
with that theme. Moreover, we would like to have implemented a larger window with more aesthetically pleasing GUI display visuals.

## Key Features

- Interactive Graphic User Interface (GUI): On a graphic screen, the game randomly selects a word that the user must guess. Each correct letter of the word pops up on the screen with every correct attempt throughout the game. If the guess is incorrect, an illustration of a hangman progressively appears with every wrong attempt until the game is over. 
- Illustrative Images: If a user successfully guesses the word, an image of a happy squirrel will appear on the screen. If a user does not successfully guess the correct word, an image of a sad squirrel will appear. 
- Descriptive labels: In the top part of the window, a representation of the hidden word with dashes indicates that its letters have not yet been guessed, and when guessed, it will update, revealing the letter and its position. Each dash represents a hidden letter of the word. At the bottom, a label with the number of attempts for each game is located. The label updates with every attempt, decreasing from 6 to 0.
